compile and execution are two steps

JDK has JRE component javaruntime environmant and it has JVM java virtual machine and they are stored levelwise;
the source code goes into compiler and compiler is in JDK and the SC is converted in byte code and its extension is .class.
and that code can be run on any device we cannot do this thing with c /c++ hence java is the portable langiage .

stage 2
execution:

the byte code goes via JVM and convert into native code the code that can be undestood by machine.
